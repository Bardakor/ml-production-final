# Development Branch Update

This demonstrates the proper Git workflow for the ML Production project.

## Workflow
1. Development happens on `dev` branch
2. When ready, push to `staging` for testing  
3. When staging tests pass, merge to `main` for production

This update shows the CI/CD pipeline working correctly.
